# Wooden Cog

## IMPORTANT
I dropped this mod, it was a cool project but i'm not aligned with some TFC changes and ideas so i'm not as hyped on working on this mod as i was previously.
Don't expect me to work on this anymore, but the code will still be available to anyone who want to start working on it again ! just fork it !

I'm a little sad to drop this mod but i can't get myself to work on this mod or play again a TFC pack, sorry for the false hope of this project.

In case you want to work on it but you're not sure if you have the "talent" to do it try, to be honest the hardest part about this mod is reading the spaghetti of others dev to do my own spaghetti, it's not that hard but take some time, anyone with a little experience with JAVA can work on this just fine, think of this repo as a stepping stone for your project. (also use the java debugger it's a greater tool than logging in case of debugging)

## INFO
this mod is a compatibility mod for tfc and create.

Some of it's code came from [SeriousCreeper](https://www.youtube.com/@SeriousCreeper)
go check him out his videos are pretty cool. Also here's the original [mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tfc-create)

Some of the code also came from the [Tinker's construct](https://github.com/SlimeKnights/TinkersConstruct) mod (the small crucible) I updated it to my needs.

This mod is still in early stages and probably need a lot refactoring but still can be used.
I'll soon update my generators (yeah the nodejs mess in generators dir) to generate all missing crafts in this mod.

currently it includes :
- recipes for alloying with mixer
- custom basin to allow more fluids into it (4)
- some fixes for create mod that where needed for liquid only crafts
- some fixes on filters to allow tfc fluid usage (still need to check if it didn't broke anything else)

I don't know if this mod is compatible with other mod that use mixins for create but if you know one that don't work
open an issue on this repo i'll look into it

pull requests are welcomed.
